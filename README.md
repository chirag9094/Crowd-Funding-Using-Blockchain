# Crowd-Funding-Using-Blockchain

## Overview
Crowdfunding using Blockchain is a decentralized application (DApp) implemented in Solidity and developed using the Remix IDE. This project facilitates secure and transparent fundraising campaigns powered by blockchain technology. By leveraging smart contracts, contributors can participate in crowdfunding campaigns directly through the Ethereum network, ensuring trust and accountability in fundraising activities.

## Key Features
1. Decentralized Fundraising: Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to create a decentralized platform for crowdfunding campaigns.
2. Transparency and Security: Ensures transparency of transactions and fund allocation through immutable blockchain records.
3. Solidity Smart Contracts: Implements crowdfunding logic using Solidity, the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts.
4. Remix IDE: Developed and tested in the Remix IDE, providing an easy-to-use environment for Ethereum contract development.
5. Documentation: Detailed explanation of the code functionality and operation, along with output images, is provided in the Output.docx file.
